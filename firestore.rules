/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-specific data, such as focus sessions, is nested within a user's own document tree. This ensures that users can only access and modify their own information, preventing any cross-user data access.
 * Data Structure: The data is organized hierarchically under the `/users/{userId}` path. Each user has their own document containing their profile, and a subcollection `focusSessions` for Pomodoro timer data.
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: The primary security mechanism is path-based ownership. A user's authenticated UID must match the `{userId}` in the document path to gain access.
 * - No Public User Listing: Listing documents in the top-level `/users` collection is explicitly disallowed to protect user privacy and prevent enumeration attacks.
 * - Ownership Integrity: For all subcollection documents, the internal `userId` field must match the `{userId}` from the path upon creation, and this field is immutable. This creates a durable and verifiable link between the data and its owner.
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The data structure is inherently optimized for security rules. By placing user-specific data in a subcollection under `/users/{userId}`, ownership can be checked simply by inspecting the path. This avoids the need for slow and costly `get()` calls to other documents for authorization checks.
 * Structural Segregation: The use of distinct collections (`users`, `focusSessions`) ensures that a single, clear security posture can be applied to each data type, simplifying the rules and enhancing security.
